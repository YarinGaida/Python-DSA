# 🐍 DSA Implementations in Python

This repo is my personal collection of Data Structures and Algorithms, built from scratch.
The main goal here wasn't just to write code that works, but to understand the logic and complexity "under the hood" without relying on external libraries.

Everything here is written in pure Python.

## 📂 What's Inside

### 1. Sorting
Classic sorting algorithms implemented to visualize $O(n^2)$ vs $O(n \log n)$.
- [x] **Insertion Sort**
- [x] **Merge Sort** (Recursive implementation)
- [x] **Quick Sort**
- [x] **Heap Sort** (Using my own Max-Heap structure)
- [ ] **Bucket Sort**

### 2. Data Structures
Building the foundations.
- [x] **Linked Lists** (Singly & Doubly)
- [x] **Stacks & Queues**
- [x] **Binary Heaps** (Includes `build_max_heap` and `heapify`)
- [ ] **Binary Search Trees (BST)**

### 3. Graphs & Traversal
Basic navigation of nodes and edges.
- [x] **BFS** (Breadth-First Search)
- [x] **DFS** (Depth-First Search)
- [x] **Topological Sort** (Directed Acyclic Graphs)

### 4. Shortest Path (Weighted Graphs)
Solvers for weighted graph problems.
- [x] **Dijkstra** (Using Priority Queue)
- [x] **Bellman-Ford** (Handling negative edges)
- [x] **Floyd-Warshall** (All-pairs shortest path)

### 5. Network Flow & MST
Advanced graph theory implementations.
- [x] **Prim's Algorithm** (Minimum Spanning Tree)
- [x] **Ford-Fulkerson** (Max Flow)
- [x] **Edmonds-Karp** (BFS optimization for Max Flow)
